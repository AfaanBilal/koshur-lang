## Syntax

Koshur-lang has a very brief syntax. Semi-colons are required except after expressions.

### Comments
```
# This is a comment
```

### Print to screen
```
wan("Hello!");
```

### Variables
```
x = 10;
y = 20;

wan(x); # Prints 10
wan(y); # Prints 20
```

### Control flow
- `poz` means `true`
- `apuz` means `false`
- `yeli` means `if`
- `nate` means `else`
- `teli` means `then` and is only required after `if` when braces (`{}`) are skipped.

```
yeli poz {
    wan("Poz chu!");
} nate {
    wan("Apuz hasa!");
};

yeli apuz teli
    wan("apuz!")
nate
    wan("poz!");
```

### Functions
Functions in **koshur-lang** are lambdas.
```
bod-kus = banav(x, y) yeli x > y teli x nate y;

wan(bod-kus(10, 20)); # Prints 20
```
This creates a function (lambda) named `bod-kus` which returns the bigger of the two parameters.
